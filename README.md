Q3) Three Coins are tossed, find the probability that two heads and one tail are obtained?

Ans: P (Two heads and one tail) = N (Event (Two heads and one tail)) / N (Event (Three
coins tossed)) = 3/8 = 0.375 = 37.5%

Q4) Two Dice are rolled, find the probability that sum is
a)	Equal to 1
b)	Less than or equal to 4
c)	Sum is divisible by 2 and 3

Ans: 
a)	Equal to 1 = The set of possible outcomes when we roll a die are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} So, when we roll two dice there are 6 × 6 = 36 outcomes. There is no any moment when the sum of dice is 1 Therefore, the P (sum is equal to 1) = 0/36=0.

b) Less than or equal to 4 = (Sum is less than or equal to 4) = N (Event (Sum is less than or equal to 4)) / N (Event (Two dice rolled)) = 6 / 36 = 1/6 = 0.166 = 16.66%

c)Sum is divisible by 2 and 3 = (Sum is less than or equal to 4) = N (Event (Sum is less than or equal to 4)) / N (Event (Two dice rolled)) = 6 / 36 = 1/6 = 0.166 = 16.66%

A	1	0.015
B	4	0.20
C	3	0.65
D	5	0.005
E	6	0.01
F	2	0.120
Child A – probability of having 1 candy = 0.015.
Child B – probability of having 4 candies = 0.20

ANS: = 1*0.015 + 4*0.20 + 3*0.65 + 5*0.005 + 6*0.01 + 2*0.120 = 0.015+0.8+1.95+0.025+0.06+0.240 =3.090

2)By looking at the boxplot I can say that most of the student’s marks lies between 35 to 45

Q13) What is the nature of skewness when mean, median of data are equal?

ANS: Skewness refers to a distortion or asymmetry that deviates from the symmetrical bell curve, or normal distribution, in a set of data. If the curve is shifted to the left or to the right, it is said to be skewed. Skewness can be quantified as a representation of the extent to which a given distribution varies from a normal distribution. A normal distribution has a skew of zero. When mean, median and mode is equal then it is a normal distribution. So, the nature of skewness is zero when mean and median of data is equal.

Q14) What is the nature of skewness when mean > median ?

ANS: When the value of mean is greater than median and mode then it is called positive skewed. So, the nature of skewness is positive when mean > median.

Q15) What is the nature of skewness when median > mean?

ANS: When the value of mean is less than median and mode then it is called negative skewed. So, the nature of skewness is negative when median > mean.

Q16) What does positive kurtosis value indicates for a data?

ANS: Positive values of kurtosis indicate that distribution is peaked and possesses thick tails. An extreme positive kurtosis indicates a distribution where more of the numbers are located in the tails of the distribution instead of around the mean. It means that the dataset has more outliers or extreme values compared to a normal distribution.

Q17) What does negative kurtosis value indicates for a data?

ANS: A negative kurtosis value indicates that a dataset has lighter tails and a flatter peak compared to the normal distribution, which is known as platykurtic distribution. In simpler terms, it means that the dataset has fewer outliers or extreme values compared to a normal distribution.

Q18) Answer the below questions using the below boxplot visualization.

3) The Inter Quantile Range = Q3 Upper quartile – Q1 Lower Quartile = 18 – 10 =8

Q 24)   A Government company claims that an average light bulb lasts 270 days. A researcher randomly selects 18 bulbs for testing. The sampled bulbs last an average of 260 days, with a standard deviation of 90 days. If the CEO's claim were true, what is the probability that 18 randomly selected bulbs would have an average life of no more than 260 days
Hint:  
   rcode   pt(tscore,df)  
 df  degrees of freedom

ANS:  

Null Hypothesis: Avg life of Bulb >= 260 days

Alternative Hypothesis: Avg life of Bulb < 260 days

Population mean(pmean) =260

Sample mean(smean)=270

Sample size(n)=18 bulbs

Sample standard deviation(sd)=90 days

t=(pmean-smean)/(sd/math.sqrt(n)

t=-0.4714052

pvalue= 1-stats.t.cdf(abs(t), df=18-1)

pvalue=0.32167411

Therefore, the probability that 18 randomly selected bulbs would have an average life of no more than 260 days, if the CEO's claim were true, is approximately 0.321 or 32%.
